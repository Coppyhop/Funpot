# Funpot
Yet another discord bot.

Designed to be a successor to the original Funpot, this bot has an emphasis on user customizability and choice, 
and as such comes with no commands at all (except commands to make commands), instead letting the users design the bot through adding
config files for commands and entering new configurations into the bot itself.
