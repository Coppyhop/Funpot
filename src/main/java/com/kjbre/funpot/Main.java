 * Description: This is the main class file for the Funpot project. This is a total rewrite of my
 *              Ongoing hobby of maintaining a discord bot. Aiming to be fully open-source, this
 *              will aim to follow style guidelines (for practice) and readability for others to
 *              learn from my work. I do not aim for this to be the most feature-rich discord bot,
 *              but I do aim for it to be one of the most customizable.
